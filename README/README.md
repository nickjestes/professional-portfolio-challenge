# professional-portfolio-challenge

// I wasn't the most happy with what is to be the final result of the project but I want to
 resubmit a more polished version in regards to the concepts I don't understand after meeting with a tutor //

I built the page with a nav bar, headers, with several images that will create a solid gold border
when hovered over. The images also flex into order when the page closed. Flex box was a really tough
issue, I did the flexfroggy game to help with the concept but I'm still struggling on the organization.

My issue was the left headers would not squeeze in exactly the way I wanted, but I got as close as possible.

I set the links at the bottom to deadlinks that currently link to the top of the page as a result.
